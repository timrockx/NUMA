### Functionality & Specifications:

This program is designed to support a total of 3 user interfaces:
- Tenant Interface
- Property Manager Interface
- NUMA Manager Interface

The program is designed to handle any and all exceptions, along with providing meanful error messages to our users.  

The NUMA Database currently contains a total of 5 Properties, with a range of 8-15 Apartments per Property.

Below will detail the exact functionality of each user interface and how to interact with it.

File Structure: 

    I have already compiled the code in Sunlab, however you can choose to do so again.
    CD into [tyl224] directory, and run [javac *.java]. Then run [mv *.class ../tyl224exec].
    CD into the [tyl224exec] directory, and generate the jar file with [jar cfmv tyl224.jar Manifest.txt Connect.class Manager.class Tenant.class numaManager.class].

    Run project by cd into [tyl224exec] directory, and run [java -jar tyl224.jar].

## Tenant Interface

    - Login to the Tenant Interface by selecting it on the main menu, then entering a valid Tenant ID.
    - Valid ID's: [1-29 EXCLUDING 21 and 22]. When adding a new tenant, login with 29 + 1 (incrementally increasing from max.)

        1. Make a payment on rent.
        2. View payment history.
        3. View amenities offered at their property.
        4. Add roommates.
        5. Update personal information.

    - Notes:
      - Tenants [1-5] have all made complete payments on their rent. (0 remaining balance)
      - Tenants [6-10] have made partial payments on their rent.
      - Tenants [10-29, excluding 21 and 22] have not made any payments on rent, but have payment info on record.

        3. Record a visit by a prospective tenant.
        4. Move in a new tenant to an apartment.
        5. Move a tenant out from their apartment.
